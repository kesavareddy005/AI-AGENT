## üìù 3. Description

### IMDB Sentiment Analysis
This notebook begins with loading and preprocessing the IMDB dataset, transforming text data into numerical representations using tokenization and embedding layers. The project applies a recurrent neural network (RNN) or LSTM to capture the temporal dependencies of words in a review. It culminates with evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

Key steps:
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Tokenization and word embeddings
- Model architecture (LSTM/GRU-based)
- Model training and validation
- Visualization of loss and accuracy

---

### Health Care Status Prediction
The notebook implements a classification model to predict an individual's health status based on numeric features (e.g., cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.). It includes:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Preprocessing (scaling, normalization)
- Model architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Training and evaluation
- Classification report and confusion matrix

---

### Cat vs Dog Image Classification
This notebook leverages transfer learning for efficient and accurate image classification.

- Dataset loading using `ImageFolder`
- Data augmentation and preprocessing
- Model architecture: Pre-trained CNN (ResNet / VGG)
- Model fine-tuning for cat-dog images
- Training loop and early stopping
- Visualization of predictions on test images
