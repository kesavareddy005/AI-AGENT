## üìÅ 1. Project Content

This project includes the following stages:

- **Data Acquisition**: Loading the IMDB dataset using TensorFlow Datasets.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, sequence padding, and data batching.
- **Model Building**: Implementing an RNN architecture using LSTM layers in TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model Training**: Compiling and training the model with suitable hyperparameters.
- **Model Evaluation**: Visualizing accuracy and loss over training epochs.
- **Testing and Inference**: Evaluating the model with new data.

df = pd.read_csv('/content/IMDB Dataset.csv')
display(df.head())
display(df.info())
```
```python
import re
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords

nltk.download('stopwords')
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

def clean_text(text):
    text = text.lower()
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    text = ' '.join([word for word in text.split() if word not in stop_words])
    return text

df['cleaned_review'] = df['review'].apply(clean_text)
display(df.head())
```
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_review'])

```
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

model = MultinomialNB()

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

print("Model training complete.")
```
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

            print(f"Review: {new_review}\nPredicted Sentiment: {prediction}\n")
        else:
            print("Please enter a review.")

# Link button click to function

## üìù 4. Description

The IMDB sentiment analysis project is an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for binary classification of movie reviews:

- We use the IMDB dataset containing 50,000 reviews split equally between positive and negative sentiments.
- The dataset is tokenized and padded to uniform sequence lengths for input to the neural network.
- An **LSTM-based RNN** model is constructed for capturing the sequential nature of text data.
- The model is compiled using **binary crossentropy loss** and trained using the **Adam optimizer**.
- Model accuracy and loss are tracked during training and visualized using plots.

This project demonstrates how deep learning models can extract insights from text data for real-world NLP tasks.
