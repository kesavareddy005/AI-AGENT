## üìù 4. Description

The Cat vs Dog project demonstrates how deep learning can effectively distinguish images of cats and dogs through:

- **Data Preparation**: Images are resized to 150x150 and augmented (random flips, rotations).
- **Modeling**: A simple yet powerful CNN architecture is used.
- **Training**: The model is trained with a binary cross-entropy loss function, using `Adam` optimizer for fast convergence.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy and loss metrics are plotted to ensure stable training.

This project highlights the workflow of deep learning pipelines and the practical usage of CNNs in real-world classification tasks.

## üìä 5. Output

### Model Performance
The model achieves ~85-90% accuracy on the validation set after 10 epochs, showing a solid performance in distinguishing cats from dogs.

### Sample Predictions

## üî¨ 6. Further Research

Here are some ideas to expand and enhance this project:

- **Data Augmentation**: Incorporate more aggressive augmentations (e.g., random zooms, color jitter).
- **Advanced Architectures**: Use pretrained models like ResNet or EfficientNet for transfer learning.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with different optimizers, learning rates, and dropout rates.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Develop a web app that uses the trained model to classify user-uploaded images in real-time.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Test the model on a larger, more diverse dataset to enhance generalization.
